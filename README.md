# CBV2 (ChessBoard Version 2)

Make sure to explain why the heck I am working on this... again o_0

## TODO
* rename Board to Position and associate with only the appropriate characteristics
* make all of is[blank]Legal functions into methods of class Position (class Board)
* come up with a consistent plan for when to throw an error and when to return some nonsense like null or undefined
* make actual objects for Square and Move
    * will simplify conversion from object to string (and vice versa?)
* allow player to claim a 50-move-rule draw / enable auto-detection
